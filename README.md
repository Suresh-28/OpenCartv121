Hybrid Framework in Automation Testing 



ðŸ›  E-commerce Website Automation (Hybrid Framework - Selenium, Java):
Developed and implemented a Hybrid Test Automation Framework integrating Keyword-Driven, Data-Driven, and Modular Driven approaches to enhance test efficiency and maintainability. Utilized Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, Apache POI (Excel), and Page Object Model (POM) for structured test execution.

ðŸ”¹ Framework Design:
- Designed a reusable and scalable Hybrid Framework integrating test scripts with external test data sources.
- Implemented Page Object Model (POM) for modularizing UI components and improving maintainability.
- Used Apache POI to fetch test data dynamically from Excel sheets for data-driven testing.
- Integrated TestNG for test execution, parallel execution, and reporting.

ðŸ”¹ Test Coverage & Execution:
- Automated key e-commerce functionalities such as user authentication, product search, cart management, checkout process, and order.
- Conducted cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) to ensure compatibility.
- Integrated loggers and screenshots for failed test cases using Log4j and Selenium listeners.
- Scheduled test execution using Jenkins CI/CD pipeline to enable automated test runs after every code deployment.

ðŸ”¹Reporting: 
- Integrated with Extent Reports and TestNG Reports.
- Collaborated with developers to analyze test failures and resolve defects efficiently.

ðŸ”¹ **Outcome & Impact:**
- Reduced manual testing effort by **70%** through automation, improving test execution speed.
- Enhanced maintainability and scalability of the automation suite, reducing test maintenance time by **50%**.
